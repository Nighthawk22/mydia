defmodule Mydia.Jobs.DownloadMonitor do
  @moduledoc """
  Background job for monitoring downloads and handling completion.

  With download clients as the source of truth, this job now focuses on:
  - Detecting completed downloads in clients
  - Marking downloads as completed in the database
  - Triggering media import jobs for completed downloads
  - Recording errors for failed downloads
  - Flagging downloads that were removed from clients

  ## Missing Download Detection

  When a download is manually removed from a download client (e.g., Transmission),
  the job will detect this and mark the download as "missing" with an error message.
  This preserves the download in the Issues tab so users can investigate why the
  download was removed before import completed. Users can manually delete from
  the Issues tab if desired.
